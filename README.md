# üî≠ Current Projects:

I am currently working on my [SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis emulator](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/MD68000)
which tackles the complexities of emulating the CISC Architecure
that fashioned that console. 

On top of reverse engineering various video games such as 
[Mario Kart Wii](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/revo). All with the ambition of creating modifications to those pre-existing games.

As of recently, I have become enamoured by Reverse Engineering on top of creating the toolkits necessary to make such technical advancemeents.
One of my many projects at the moment consist of making a Driver plugin for the Gamecube Adapater for the PC version of [Sonic Heroes](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/HEROES_WUP28)

Furthermore, making a Reverse Engineering toolkit using Java that looks at the parsing of contents of Dreamcast ROMS for [Ghidra](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/gdiGhidra)

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Experience:

I'm an aspiring Computer Architect looking to become a Doctor in my relevant field, as such my profiency lies in C/C++. 
I highly leverage C/ASM for my Low Level endeavours 
which involve Reverse Engineering, creating Low Level Modifcations and infrastructures using that RE knowledge.

I have been using C/C++, ASM for 1 year and I have gained an adequate level of knowledge during that time.
During this time, I have expanded my repitoure in terms of which problems I am able to solve and which technical skills I can demonstrate by learning Java

Expanding my codebase to various other languages on the Low Level end of the spectrum on top of exploring build automation tools and frameworks.
I continue to move forward with prosperity for my future projects and expansion of my repitoure.
