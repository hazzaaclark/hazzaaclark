# ⚡️ Experience:

Given that I'm an aspiring Computer Architect, my profiency lies in C/C++. I highly leverage C++ for my Low Level endeavours 
which involve Reverse Engineering creating Low Level Modifcations and infrastructures using that RE knowledge.

I have been using C++ for no less than 1 year and I like to say that I have learnt a lot during that time.
As I continue to move forward with prosperity for my future projects and expansion of my repitoure.

# 🏆 Achievements:

• Part of the Formula One Silverstone Team as an Engineer (2023 - Present)
• Game Design Course Representative (2020 - 2022)
