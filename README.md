# üî≠ Current Projects:

I am currently working on my [SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis emulator](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/MD68000)
which tackles the complexities of emulating the CISC Architecure
that fashioned that console. 

On top of reverse engineering various video games such as [The Simpsons: Hit and Run](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/donut_wii)
and [Mario Kart Wii](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/mkw-data). All with the ambition of creating modifications to those pre-existing games.

As of recently, I have tackled the endeavour of Modifications to old Games consoles such as SEGA's Consoles
as well as the Nintendo Wii console.
Upon becoming enamored with the underlying architecture of that console, I am working on a foray of Assembly projects to pursue this passion.

In addition, I am continuing to seek the possibilities of Embedded Systems & Computer Architecture through
making a [SEGA Dreamcast](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/DreamPi)  extension for the Raspberry Pi Pico; providing the functionality of the controller on PC

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Experience:

I'm an aspiring Computer Architect looking to become a Doctor in my relevant field, as such my profiency lies in C/C++. I highly leverage C++ for my Low Level endeavours 
which involve Reverse Engineering, creating Low Level Modifcations and infrastructures using that RE knowledge.

As well as creating software that tackle the complexities of emulating or modifying Computer Architecures.

I have been using C++ for no less than 1 year and I like to say that I have learnt a lot during that time.
Being given prestigeous opportunities at University by becoming part of the FSAI Team.
I continue to move forward with prosperity for my future projects and expansion of my repitoure.

# üèÜ Achievements:

‚Ä¢ Part of the Formula One Silverstone Team as an Engineer (2023)

‚Ä¢ Game Design Course Representative @ Newcastle & Stafford College Groups (2020 - 2022)
