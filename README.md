# üî≠ Current Projects:

I am currently working on my [SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis emulator](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/MD68000)
which tackles the complexities of emulating the CISC Architecure
that fashioned that console. 

As well as reverse engineering various video games such as [The Simpsons: Hit and Run](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/donut-rpc)
and [Mario Kart Wii](https://github.com/hazzaaclark/mkw-data). All with the ambition of creating modifications to those pre-existing games.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Experience:

I'm an aspiring Computer Architect, as such my profiency lies in C/C++. I highly leverage C++ for my Low Level endeavours 
which involve Reverse Engineering, creating Low Level Modifcations and infrastructures using that RE knowledge.

As well as creating software that tackle the complexities of emulating or modifying Computer Architecures.

I have been using C++ for no less than 1 year and I like to say that I have learnt a lot during that time.
As I continue to move forward with prosperity for my future projects and expansion of my repitoure.

# üèÜ Achievements:

‚Ä¢ Part of the Formula One Silverstone Team as an Engineer (2023 - Present)

‚Ä¢ Game Design Course Representative (2020 - 2022)
